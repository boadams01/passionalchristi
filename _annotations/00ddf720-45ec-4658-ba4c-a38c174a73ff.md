In contrast to Christ's indifference to the taxation required for the temple, the pope was the instigator of the press for income to build St. Peter's, so Cranach shows the facing image as his covetous use of indulgences to raise funds.  Surrounded by his usual entourage of cardinals, bishops, friars, and monks, the pope sits high above the secular figures of the emperor in his arched crown and armor, facing inward from the lower left with another knight in armor beside him.  Those Germanic figures are being dunned for money by a monk and a nun, who already hold a bag of coins, bestowed from the emperor by his armored associate; they are followed by a theologian in a doctor's cap, or biretta.  Meanwhile the outstretched right hand of the pope above holds an indulgence, solemnly certified with no fewer than three attached seals.  It hovers over the head of the emperor and his adjacent knight, but it also gives off pestilence in the form of lightning bolts and hail, much as late medieval woodcuts of witches showed them brewing up storms descending from clouds as a punishment.  Thus does Cranach show the papal indulgences as an evil scourge, by implication equating the pope with the evil malevolence associated with witches (and anticipating the final image of the Passional, where the pope descends into Hell).
