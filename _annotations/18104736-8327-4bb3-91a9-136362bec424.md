Translation: The Pope imitates tyrants and pagan princes who hold out their feet for the people to kiss so that it becomes true, which is written: Any who does not worship this image of the beast, is to be killed. Revelation 13[:15]. No
doubt by means of this kissing of the foot may the Pope in his decretals
outrageously demand to be praised. " If the highest pontiff then
pronounces excommunication.
