In this image Jesus once more appears in a wilderness, leaving a small copse of trees at the right edge for a mountain climb, en route to another spiritual retreat (see comment for Plate 1). He is accompanied by only a pair of disciples, foremost of whom is Peter, recognizable from his bald head and short white beard.  His physical weakness emerges in the first passage, which mentions his weariness (John 4: 6), reinforced by the effort required to carry the cross (John 19: 17), which is also urged upon his followers (Matthew 16: 24).  What is stressed here is spiritual effort and individual responsibility for his disciples to follow him.
