Once more Cranach's New Testament image reprises a conventional subject: the Nativity in the ruined stable, with a background vignette of the angelic good tidings to the shepherds.  Like all the other images from the Gospels, this one emphasizes the simplicity and humility of the holy figures, especially the swaddled Christ Child, who appears without a halo or any angelic entourage.  These elements reinforce the poverty emphasized in the two unrelated Gospel text selections (Luke 9: 58; 
II Corinthians 8:9).
