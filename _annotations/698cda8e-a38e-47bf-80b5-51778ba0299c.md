Translation: Go to the sea and cast your fishing line. Open the mouth of the first fish you catch. Inside you will find a gulden, give it for my tax and for yours.
Matthew 17[:27]. Give to the authority, [which has the sword in its
hands], its feeâ€”interest to him who is entitled to interest, tariff to him
who is entitled to tariff. Romans 13[:4,6-7].
