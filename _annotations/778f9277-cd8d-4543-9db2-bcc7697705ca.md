Following the text of John 13: 4-16, Jesus kneels to wash the feet of his own apostles, inverting the normal hierarchy of holiness and authority in servitude and humility (literally close to the earth, humus).  He is about to kiss the foot of his follower.  The Gospel message (v. 16) underscores the body language provided in this visual lesson: "Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him."  In this more conventional image, the apostles are dressed like Jesus, wearing humble garments.
