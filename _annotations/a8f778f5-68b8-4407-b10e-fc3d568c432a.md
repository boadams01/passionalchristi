Jesus is preaching with speaking gestures under a tree at right within the wilderness, as the apostles look on opposite him. The associated text emphasizes his sermonizing (Luke 4: 43-44).  Seated at his feet on the lower left within his audience are several prominent mothers with children, a favorite subject by Cranach in his later Lutheran paintings (Matthew 19: 13-15).   Within the framework of the emerging Lutheran theology this theme had a strong evangelical value: for one, it reinforced the principle of infant baptism, already a contested debate among Reformers; but it also had the value of emphasizing the doctrine of sola fide, where the innocent trust of children could be likened to the faith required of Christian true believers.
