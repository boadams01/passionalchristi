Before the pope in obeisance kneel the rulers of the Germanic world, headed by the emperor himself, wearing the arched crown (see Plate 1) as well as golden chains.  A king or duke with a simpler crown kneels behind him , followed by humbler figures in contemporary urban bourgeois dress.  All of them are situated below the feet of the pope, who blesses them from his elevated position of authority but also extends his own covered foot to be kissed by the emperor, who is thus deliberately humbled further.
