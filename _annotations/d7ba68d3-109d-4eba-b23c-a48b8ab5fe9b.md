Translation: We decide what jurisdiction secular officials possess over the clergy, whether they may exercise punishment, or collect taxes, or whether the
church may demand the same from clergy as from households, or grant
exemption, along with the [sacraments, excommunication, and
interdict]. Thus the Pope by his mandates tears to pieces the mandates
of God, by the work of his impious and antichristian decretals.
